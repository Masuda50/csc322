	Uses Python Flask and MYSQL

Summary: 
 
  		This website will facilitate an active teaming of people with similar interest and skill-set to forge groups for a certain do-good project.For a random visitor, the system provides a home page showcasing the top 3 rated projects and top rating OU profiles and SU profiles to showcase the power of the system. A visitor can surf around to find more OUs/VIPs and projects. Visitors also have the option to register to be an OU: If approved, they can login will a password sent to their email. If rejected, the applicant has one chance to appeal and the SU will make a final decision to reverse the rejection. OUs can form groups by inviting other OU(s) for a certain purpose: Once a group is formed, a group web-page should be made available that is accessible to all group members All group members can moderate and post to the group page. This page will be used for posting updates and scheduling meet-ups. An OU whose reputation score is higher than 30 will be promoted to VIP; and a VIP whose score is lower than 25 will be demoted.
